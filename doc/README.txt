=========================================================================



2. OVERVIEW

The Base TRD is an embedded video processing application designed to showcase
various features and capabilities of Zynq Z-7020 All Programmable SoC (AP SoC)
device for the embedded domain. The Base TRD consists of two elements: The
Zynq-7000 AP SoC Processing System (PS) and a video processing pipeline
implemented in Programmable Logic (PL). The AP SoC allows the user to implement
a video processing algorithm that performs edge detection on an image (Sobel
filter) either as a software program running on the Zynq-7000 AP SoC PS or as
a hardware accelerator inside the PL.

The Base TRD demonstrates how the user can seamlessly switch between a software
or a hardware implementation and evaluate the cost and benefit of each
implementation. The TRD also demonstrates the value of offloading computation
intensive tasks onto PL, thereby freeing the CPU resources to be available for
user-specific applications.

The package consists of two video based application projects which differ
in user interface.
a) video_qt application has a graphical user interface designed
using QT framework.
b) video_cmd application has a command line based menu where the user can
navigate the menu by typing options into the terminal.

This package is based on the Xilinx Zynq TRD and all the Xilinx instructions
apply except for the u-boot,Linux kernel, device-tree and applications build that contain some diferences.
For information on how to use this package, along with build instructions,
please refer:
 - http://www.wiki.xilinx.com/Zynq+Base+TRD+2014.4
 - Chapter 5. Building Design

3. SOFTWARE TOOLS AND SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS

Software:
  -- Vivado Design Suite 2014.4
  -- Proper installation of required license files for the TRD.
  -- Optional: ZedBoard board uses CP210x USB to UART Bridge to provide COM port
     connection to the board. This configuration is highly recommended because
     the UART outputs information to hyper terminal right after power up.
     To use this feature, hyper terminal, Minicom, teraterm or equivalent
     terminal software on the host machine is required. For details, please
     refer to UG925 for USB-to-UART Bridge driver installation.
  -- For additional information on software installation, refer to UG798.

Hardware:
  -- The reference design targets the Zynq ZedBoard evaluation board, Rev C or
     above.
  -- ZedBoard evaluation board setup in the default configuration as documented
     in the Default Switch and Jumper Setting:
     http://zedboard.org/sites/default/files/documentations/GS-AES-Z7EV-7Z020-G-V7.pdf
  -- AC power adapter (12VDC)
  -- HDMI-to-HDMI or HDMI-to-DVI cable (depending on available Monitor)
  -- Monitor capable of supporting 1080p60 / 720p60
  -- USB Type-A Female to USB Micro-B Male cable
  -- USB hub
  -- USB mouse
  -- Optional: USB Type A Male to USB Mini-B Male cable if using USB-to-UART
     bridge
  -- Optional: Avnet FMC IMAGEON daughter card for video input with 1080p / 720p
     input video source
  -- SD memory card reader for transferring files onto the SD card.
     (not included in the package)

5. INSTALLATION AND OPERATING INSTRUCTIONS


ZedBoard Initial Setup:
--------------------

-- All jumpers and switches should be in default setting except JP7 to JP11.
   Jumpers JP7 to JP11 should be set to boot from SD card.
   See image for SD boot in 
   http://zedboard.org/sites/default/files/documentations/GS-AES-Z7EV-7Z020-G-V7.pdf (Figure 2):
   JP7  : GND
   JP8  : GND
   JP9  : VCC
   JP10 : VCC
   JP11 : GND
-- Connect one end of the HDMI cable to board HDMI connector, connect the other
   end to the monitor's HDMI or DVI input
-- Connect USB Micro-AB cable to on-board USB Micro connector USB OTG (connector J13), then connect up
   USB hub, mouse and keyboard.
-- connect the AC power adapter
-- Optional: If USB-to-UART bridge is used, connect USB Micro-AB side of USB-to-
   Micro-AB cable to the on-board mini USB connector UART (connector J14). Connect USB side to
   the control PC.
-- Optional: If Avnet Imageon card is used, connect the card to FMC slot (connector J1).
   Connect 1080p/720p video input source to HDMI-IN.

   
FPGA design differences between the Xilinx Zc702 TRD and ZED Base TRD
------------------------------------------------------------------
-- logiCVC pixel clock source is now FPGA core logiCLK

SW design differences between the Xilinx Zc702 TRD and ZED TRD
------------------------------------------------------------------
-- u-boot: uses zynq_zed_config
-- dts: uses Zed instead of ZC702, logiCLK added, interrupts changed
-- Kernel sources kernel_logiclk_added.patch: logiCLK driver added
-- Kernel config is inherited from Xilinx and modified with the following options:
        > Device Drivers > Common Clock Framework
            < > Clock driver for SiLabs 570 and compatible devices
            <*> logiCLK driver
        > Device Drivers > USB support > USB Physical Layer drivers
            <*> Xilinx Zynq USB OTG dual-role support
-- ready_to_test/autostart.sh, software/xsdk/video_lib/include/common.h:
   "adv7611 12-004c" is replaced with "adv7611 4-004c"

Building Design:
----------------

Xilinx instructions to Build Hardware and Software for this TRD are available at
http://www.wiki.xilinx.com/Zynq+Base+TRD+2014.4

                bash> ~/linux-xlnx-xilinx-v2014.4-trd/scripts/dtc/dtc -I dts -O dtb -o devicetree.dtb $ZYNQ_TRD_HOME/software/petalinux/subsystems/linux/configs/device-tree-fmc-video-in/system-top.dts

        Building Applications:
                Before building, extract: $ZYNQ_TRD_HOME/software/pre-built.tar.gz

The pre compiled files are kept in ready_to_test directory and can be loaded on SD card
root to get started with the design. On Linux boot up the TRD application is
auto loaded and GUI comes on the screen. Here various options can be explored.

For more details on how to Run the TRD please see UG925,User Guide.
